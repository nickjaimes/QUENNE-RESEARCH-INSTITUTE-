QUENNE INVESTOR PITCH: The Infrastructure of Autonomous Intelligence

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR INVESTORS

The Opportunity:

QUENNE represents a $1.2 trillion market opportunity in creating the foundational architecture for the next generation of autonomous systems. We're not building another AI model—we're building the operating system for autonomous intelligence that will run everything from smart cities to personalized medicine.

The Problem We're Solving:

Current AI infrastructure is hitting fundamental limits:

· Energy costs are unsustainable (GPT-4 training = $100M+ in compute)
· Latency bottlenecks prevent real-time autonomy
· Adaptation requires complete retraining (weeks/months)
· Fragmented hardware creates vendor lock-in and inefficiency

Our Solution:

The first unified architecture that integrates quantum computing, neuromorphic processing, and 6G edge intelligence—delivering 10-100x improvements in efficiency, speed, and adaptability.

The Ask:

$100M Series A to complete Phase 1 prototype and secure first commercial deployments.
Valuation: $850M post-money
Round Lead: Seeking strategic investor with industry connections
Use of Funds: 60% R&D, 20% talent acquisition, 20% commercialization

INVESTOR Q&A PREPARATION

Tough Questions & Answers:

Q: "Why do you need $100M? That's huge for Series A."
A: "This is infrastructure, not an app. We're building physical systems across quantum, neuromorphic, and edge—similar to what Tesla needed for automotive or SpaceX for rockets. The $100M gets us to first revenue and derisks the technology for Series B."

Q: "What's to stop Google from doing this?"
A: "Three things: 1) They're optimized for cloud, we're built for edge; 2) Our patent portfolio creates 3-5 year protection; 3) Their internal politics prevent this level of cross-group integration. We're the focused startup attacking their blind spot."

Q: "Your valuation seems high for pre-revenue."
A: "Compare to: Cerebras ($4B valuation for AI chips), Rigetti ($1.5B for quantum), or early NVIDIA. We're delivering the integration of both. Our $45M pipeline and $1.2T TAM justify the premium. This is the last chance to get in at single-digit billions."

Q: "What if quantum computing takes 10 more years?"
A: "Each layer delivers value independently. Neuromorphic alone gives 10x efficiency gains today. The quantum layer amplifies it, but isn't required for initial revenue. We're structured to win even with component delays."

Q: "Who is your ideal lead investor?"
A: "A strategic partner who understands this is a 10-year play. Ideally a corporate VC from semiconductor, automotive, or telecom who can accelerate customer access while providing patient capital. We want smart money that helps build, not just invests."

Key Metrics to Emphasize:

1. TAM: $1.2T by 2030
2. Efficiency gains: 10-100x improvement
3. Pipeline: $45M already identified
4. IP moat: 25+ patents filed
5. Team: Unmatched in cross-disciplinary expertise
6. Timing: 24-month window before competition emerges

Closing Script for Investor Meetings:

"Look at the convergence: quantum is here, neuromorphic chips are in production, 6G is rolling out. The company that defines how these connect will own the next era of computing. We have the team, the technology, and the timing. This isn't just an investment—it's a chance to build the foundation for autonomous everything. Let me show you how we get to $1B in revenue by 2029."
