QUENNE International Research Consortium (QIRC)

A Global Collaboration for Regulated Autonomous Intelligence

Proposal Version: 1.0
Year: 2026
Lead Institution: QUENNE Research Institute (Japan)
Founder & Doctrine Steward: Nicolas E. Santiago

⸻

1. Executive Overview

The QUENNE International Research Consortium (QIRC) is proposed as a neutral, multi-national research alliance dedicated to the scientific development, validation, and governance of regulated autonomous intelligence.

QIRC is established to address a growing global challenge:

Advanced intelligence systems are increasing in autonomy faster than our ability to ensure their stability, safety, and long-term societal alignment.

The consortium unites academic institutions, public research agencies, and non-commercial partners under a shared architectural doctrine, ensuring that autonomy evolves responsibly and coherently across borders.

2. Strategic Motivation

2.1 Global Context

Across nations, AI research faces common risks:
   •   fragmented architectures
   •   escalating energy demands
   •   lack of intrinsic governance
   •   incompatible safety standards

These challenges cannot be solved by any single institution or country.

2.2 Why a Consortium Is Necessary

Foundational architectures:
   •   require cross-disciplinary expertise
   •   benefit from independent validation
   •   must remain neutral and non-proprietary

QIRC provides a shared scientific ground for collaboration without centralization of power.

3. Mission & Objectives

Mission

To advance regulated, resilient, and trustworthy autonomous intelligence through international collaboration, open research, and shared governance.

Core Objectives
	1.	Develop and validate the QUENNE foundational architecture
	2.	Establish global benchmarks for resilience, energy efficiency, and stability
	3.	Coordinate cross-border pilot research programs
	4.	Promote open science and reproducibility
	5.	Serve as an advisory body for safe AI deployment

⸻

4. Scientific Scope

QIRC research focuses on:
   •   Quantum-assisted probabilistic reasoning
   •   Neuromorphic and brain-inspired learning systems
   •   Edge and real-time embodied intelligence
   •   Homeostatic and resilience-based control
   •   Distributed and swarm cognition
   •   Governance and architectural alignment of AI

Biology is treated as a reference architecture for regulation, not a compute substrate.
